According to the \"Future of Jobs Report 2025\", by \nWorld Economic Forum, AI-related skills will be necessary across nearly every industry out \nthere really soon, significantly affecting job markets and opportunities. However, even after our \nuniversity providing premium ChatGPT access, many students still do not fully understand how \nto effectively use AI tools. Without structured education, students risk missing out on \nmaximizing their academic and professional potential, which is basically as mentioned before, \nsmall things like writing an efficient prompt. \nWhile avaibility is not an issue, the structured information as well as the training that should be \nprovided, is still not there.

From my own experience, prior to proper exploration and \nguidance, my understanding of AI was indeed light and inconsistent, limiting the academic as \nwell as career benefits. \nThis brings us to the solution. San Francisco State University should implement mandatory \ngenerative AI training into our core curriculum.

Structured, gen AI \ntraining is critical to fully realize that the educational benefits of these powerful tools is beyond \nimagination. Reflecting on that particular night when using the new models turned my \nassignment around, I urge to support this initiative.
