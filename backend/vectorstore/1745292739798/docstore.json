On the landing page we have a simple looking chat picture, \nwith the name RAGBot on top left corner and Login/register part on the top right corner, and that \nis where you can start using our website. Below that, we have About us section for the the \nobvious thing, about us and about the website.  \nRight below that, we have FaQs as well as support form link to go and have some questions \nanswered. \nApproach / What I Did: \nWe used the classic Telegraf fonts with simplistic design using HTML, CSS and some \nresponsive components with Javascript. We had dark blue color in the background and we had \nlighter contrasts over it for the components. We went over step by step, and doing meeting calls \nalmost every 2 days to check the updates.","metadata":{"source":"1745292739798.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":3,"to":21}}}}],["d0c4557c-745d-4185-9aca-12123c5e8326",{"pageContent":"lighter contrasts over it for the components.

After that, we were having issues with not having proper color contrasts as well as \nsite looking pretty messy which we made simple after removing a ton of stuff to make it user \nfriendly and straightforward. And In case they need any guidance, they can always reach out for \nhelp using contact us section or the support form.","metadata":{"source":"1745292739798.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":20,"to":27}}}}],["8517778f-9006-4f2b-8098-4ee855371c10",{"pageContent":"CSC317-Section 01  Daniel | Jayden | Julian | Kunj \n2 \n  \nAnalysis:  \nThough we need to work on the frontend and A LOTS of backend, we did a good job.
