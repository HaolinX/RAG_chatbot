                RAGBot is an intelligent document assistant that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.
                It works by analyzing your uploaded PDF documents, understanding their content, and allowing you to ask
                questions about the information they contain. The system combines advanced document retrieval with
                natural language processing to provide accurate, context-aware answers directly from your documents.

        <button class="accordion">What are the benefits of using RAGBot?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                RAGBot offers several key benefits:
                • Quick information extraction from lengthy documents
                • Accurate answers based directly on your document content
                • Time-saving alternative to manual document searching
                • Secure and private document processing
                • Simple and intuitive chat interface
                • Support for multiple document types

        <button class="accordion">What file types does RAGBot support?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                Currently, RAGBot supports PDF files up to 10MB in size. We process the text content of these documents
                while maintaining their original formatting and structure. Future updates will include support for
                additional
                file formats such as DOC, DOCX, and TXT.

        <button class="accordion">How secure is my document data?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                We take data security seriously. Your documents are processed securely on our servers and are only used
                to answer your specific questions. We do not store the original documents permanently, and all processed
                data is encrypted. The system operates on a per-session basis, meaning your document data is cleared
                once
                you're done using the service.

        <button class="accordion">How accurate are RAGBot's responses?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                RAGBot's responses are highly accurate because they are directly based on the content of your documents.
                The system uses advanced AI to understand context and generate relevant answers. However, like any AI
                system,
                it works best when questions are clear and specific. The accuracy also depends on the quality and
                clarity
                of the uploaded documents.

        <button class="accordion">Are there any usage limits?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                Yes, there are some basic limits to ensure optimal performance:
                • Maximum file size: 10MB per PDF
                • Supported format: PDF files only (currently)
                • Query rate: Standard rate limiting applies to prevent system overload
                • Session duration: Automatic cleanup after extended inactivity
