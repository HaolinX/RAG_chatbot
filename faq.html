                A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is an advanced type of AI assistant that combines natural
                language generation with document retrieval. It fetches relevant information from a knowledge base or
                database and uses that to generate more accurate and context-aware responses.

        <button class="accordion">How does the RAG chatbot find answers?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                When user asks a question, the chatbot searches through a collection of documents using
                similarity matching. It retrieves the most relevant pieces of text, then uses a language model to
                generate a response based on that retrieved content.
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What kind of documents can the chatbot use?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                The chatbot can work with PDFs. As long as the documents are indexed properly during setup, the chatbot
                can retrieve information from them
                to answer questions.
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How often is the chatbot's knowledge updated?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                The chatbot's knowledge depends on the documents it retrieves from. To keep it up to date, new or
                revised documents need to be added and re-indexed.
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Can the chatbot answer questions not covered in the documents?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="panel-content">
                The chatbot is best at answering questions based on the provided documents.
